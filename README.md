Python software to compute publishable charts for defect energy formation. Chemical

## Getting started

On Windows, just copy the build/exe.win-amd64-2.7 folder and launch 
the executable PyDEF2.exe. No installation is required as long as 
the file stays inside this folder (the folder itself can be moved
wherever wanted).

To use the code from Python, check that Python 2.7 is installed
with the following libraries:
- numpy
- matplotlib
- Tkinter
- mpl_toolkits.mplot3d

and launch main.py.
